# canvasPractice
just going to play around and learn the basics

trying to start but i cant do anything without errors. i could copy code exactly and every bit is still giving me issues. i need to do more learning before i really make and progress.
i have the circle printing and the cordinates of the mouse but i cant put the two together?

its far less glitchy when it always has the lines and their size doesnt seem to matter. not exactly the design i was going for but its much cleanner.
